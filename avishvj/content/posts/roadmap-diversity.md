In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ3o24nX6ms), I summarise ''[A roadmap to increase diversity in genomic studies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01672-4)''. The paper builds a pathway towards more equitable studies in genomics drawing on case studies from Africa, Asia, Australia, and the common principles between ethical genomics at scale. The first author, Segun, outlines the paper in five tweets here: https://twitter.com/SFatumo/status/1491806516562649097. My video summary goes into more detail covering the benefits of diversity and findings from the main case studies.
