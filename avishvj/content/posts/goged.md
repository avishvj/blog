In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziRWclpQf0M), I summarise the [Geometry of gene expression dynamics](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/18/9/1176/210759) - a foundational computational biology paper from 2002 which uncovers geometry underlying cell cycle trajectories. They use methods based in Takens' embedding theorem (an idea from dynamical systems) which allows us to take points along a low-dimensional time series and create a phase plot for a full high-dimensional system - a fascinating idea! Given the recent swing towards 'omic velocity methods over the past half decade (which naturally admit geometric interpretations), it's nice to take a little look back at earlier ideas in this field. And it still seems like we're only at the start of large-scale sequencing moving into mechanistic modelling territory... check out some [incredible recent work](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(21)01577-4.pdf) in this vein by Xiaojie Qiu and colleagues.
