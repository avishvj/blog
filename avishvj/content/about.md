I’m currently doing my PhD in [AI for Healthcare at Imperial](https://ai4health.io/) with a focus on clinical multi-omics. On the ML side, I’m working on interpretability, multi-modal learning, graph and topological ML, and NLP, and on the medical side, IPF, Parkinson’s, and histopathology workflows. I’ve interned at Microsoft Research New England and I’m currently interning at NHS Data Science. Before the PhD, I did a bachelor’s in maths and computer science at Imperial and a master’s in precision medicine at UCL. My CV is available [here](../data/CV_240924.pdf).

I’m looking for internships at ‘omics FROs or pharma startups for Summer 2025 - if you're hiring, drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/avish-vijayaraghavan), [X](https://x.com/avishvj), or [email](mailto:avish.vijayaraghavan17@imperial.ac.uk)!
