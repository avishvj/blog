I’m currently doing my PhD in [AI for Healthcare at Imperial](https://ai4health.io/) with a focus on clinical multi-omics. On the ML side, I’m working on interpretability, multi-modal learning, graph and topological ML, and NLP, and on the medical side, IPF, Parkinson’s, and histopathology workflows. Before the PhD, I did a bachelor’s in maths and computer science at Imperial and a master’s in precision medicine at UCL. My CV is available [here](../data/CV_231224.pdf).

On the careers side, I’ve done a couple research internships - one with [Microsoft Research's BioML team](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/theme/biomedical-ml/), and another between the [NHS](https://nhsengland.github.io/datascience/) and [Great Ormond Street Hospital's](https://www.goshdrive.com/) Data Science teams. I was also a fellow at [No Patient Left Behind](https://www.nopatientleftbehind.org/), an organisation dedicated to making pharma innovation affordable via health insurance reform in the US.

I’m looking for internships at ‘omics FROs or pharma startups for Summer 2025 - if you're hiring, drop me a message on [LinkedIn](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/avish-vijayaraghavan), [X](https://x.com/avishvj), or [email](mailto:avish.vijayaraghavan17@imperial.ac.uk)! Outside of research, I occasionally [write](https://avishvj.github.io/), [make videos](https://www.youtube.com/@avishvijayaraghavan), and [make tunes](https://open.spotify.com/artist/77JwWnM4Tq5EOanhEguNuw).
